				<h1 class="mb-4">Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>
					Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be
					processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of
					providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its
					contents, and the services offered there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
					Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"),
					"processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as
					collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation,
					alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
					dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or
					combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
					personal data, whether by automated means or not.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular
					about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the
					processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
					with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components
					we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which
					may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and
					control.
				</p>
				<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
				<p>
					I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The
					rights of users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data
					processing
				</p>
				<h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
				<p>
					The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes
					of data protection law is:
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="color: #ff0000;">JÃ¼rgen Stary</span><br /><span
						style="color: #ff0000;"
						>Rudolf-von-Gneist-Gasse 1</span
					><br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">10785 Berlin</span><br /><span
						style="color: #ff0000;"
						>Germany</span
					>
				</p>
				<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Email: info@gremloon.io</span></p>
				<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
				<p>
					With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
					below, users and data subjects have the right
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
						information about the data being processed, further information
						about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
						also Art. 15 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>
						to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
						16 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>
						to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17
						DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as
						stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
						Art. 18 GDPR;
					</li>
					<li>
						to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
						them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers
						(cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>
						to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
						that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
						breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
					whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
					restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
					GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
					impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
					have a right to information about these recipients.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong
						>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the
						right to object to the controller's future processing of their data
						pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection
						to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
						permissible.</strong
					>
				</p>
				<h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
				<p>
					Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked
					as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the
					deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
					obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
				</p>

				<h4>Server data</h4>
				<p>
					For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
					browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially
					to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record
					the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website
					from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
					the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which
					you visited our site.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
					association with any other of your data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
					legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality,
					and security of our website.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
					continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case,
					all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the
					investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
				</p>

				<h4>Cookies</h4>
				<h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
				<p>
					We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other
					storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These
					cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your
					browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and
					secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different
					languages or to offer a shopping cart function.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR,
					insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or
					process contractual relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract,
					our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our
					website. The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
				</p>
				<p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
				<h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
				<p>
					If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with
					whom we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or
					improving the features of our website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please refer to the following information for details, in particular
					for the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and
					processing of data collected through cookies.
				</p>
				<h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
				<p>
					You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your
					browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have
					already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary,
					depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please
					use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or
					contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent
					so-called flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to
					change the setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures
					required for this also depend on the Flash player you are using. If
					you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the
					documentation for your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the
					functions on our site may be fully usable.
				</p>

				<h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
				<p>
					If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use
					the data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your
					address, or your email address) exclusively for services leading up to
					your potential placement of an order or entering some other
					contractual relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or contracts,
					and to provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of
					your previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function).
					We also store your IP address and the date and time of your
					registration. This data will not be transferred to third parties.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for
					this processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy
					policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide
					your customer account.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a)
					GDPR is the legal basis for this processing.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the
					initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an
					existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also
					Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal
					data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you
					have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as
					processing is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any
					retention periods required under tax and commercial law.
				</p>

				<h4>Contact</h4>
				<p>
					If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide
					will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have
					this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we
					will not be able to answer it in full or at all.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b)
					GDPR.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and
					there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
					order or contract resulted therefrom.
				</p>

				<h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
				<p>
					We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and
					ratings on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If
					you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your
					post, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may
					have used.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may
					revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future
					effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your
					consent.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address.
					The IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate
					interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes
					the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
					legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.
				</p>

				<h4>Twitter</h4>
				<p>
					We maintain an online presence on Twitter to present our company and
					our services and to communicate with customers/prospects. Twitter is a
					service provided by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San
					Francisco, CA 94103, USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be
					processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United
					States. This may increase risks for users that, for example, may make
					subsequent access to the user data more difficult. We also do not have
					access to this user data. Access is only available to Twitter. Twitter
					Inc. is certified under the Privacy Shield and committed to adhering
					to European privacy standards.

				<h4>LinkedIn</h4>
				<p>
					We maintain an online presence on LinkedIn to present our company and
					our services and to communicate with customers/prospects. LinkedIn is
					a service of LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Plaza, Wilton
					Place, Dublin 2, Irland, a subsidiary of LinkedIn Corporation, 1000 W.
					Maude Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94085, USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be
					processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United
					States. This may increase risks for users that, for example, may make
					subsequent access to the user data more difficult. We also do not have
					access to this user data. Access is only available to LinkedIn.

				</p>

				<h4>Social media links via graphics</h4>
				<p>
					We also integrate the following social media sites into our website.
					The integration takes place via a linked graphic of the respective
					site. The use of these graphics stored on our own servers prevents the
					automatic connection to the servers of these networks for their
					display. Only by clicking on the corresponding graphic will you be
					forwarded to the service of the respective social network.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you click, that network may record information about you and your
					visit to our site. It cannot be ruled out that such data will be
					processed in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					Initially, this data includes such things as your IP address, the date
					and time of your visit, and the page visited. If you are logged into
					your user account on that network, however, the network operator might
					assign the information collected about your visit to our site to your
					personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this
					information can be stored your personal user account and possibly
					posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to log out
					of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The
					various social media networks also offer settings that you can
					configure accordingly.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following social networks are integrated into our site by linked
					graphics:

				<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
				<p>
					We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics
					service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
					Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).
				</p>
				<p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield</p>
				<p>
					<a

					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Google guarantees that it will follow the EU's data protection
					regulations when processing data in the United States.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is
					used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
					interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of
					our site.
				</p>
				<p>
					Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time,
					or frequency of your visits to our website will be transmitted to a
					Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use
					Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function, whereby
					Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is
					transmitted to the US.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us
					with an evaluation of visits to our website and what visitors do once
					there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to
					the use of our website and of the internet in general.
				</p>
				<p>
					Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data.
					In addition, Google provides further information with regard to its
					data protection practices at
				</p>

					>
				</p>
				<p>
					including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.
				</p>
				<p>In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at</p>

						target="_blank"

						>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on
					the most popular browsers and offers you further control over the data
					that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs
					Google Analytics' JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the
					website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, this
					does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other
					web analytics services we may use as detailed herein.
